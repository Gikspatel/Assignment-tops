        <p>Belonging to an extremely <b>poor family in Bangladesh</b> Kuntola had always wanted to study but her parents were too poor to send her to school. Married at 14 and abandoned by her husband soon after the birth of her son, Kuntola felt worthless. Until, in 2005, she enrolled in BRAC’s Ultra-Poor Graduation program.  She was given some livestock, trained in animal rearing, granted stipends to help her meet her family’s daily needs and provided healthcare support. Today, as a thriving entrepreneur with a sizeable goat-rearing business, Kuntola earns 200,000 Bangladeshi Taka ($2,100) a month, enabling her to fulfil her lifelong dream of sending her son to university. <br>

            In Bihar, India, Azamati’s life too turned around dramatically.  Three years ago, this differently-abled widow thought of taking her own life. She earned just Rs. 30 (37 cents) a day as a domestic help. That was until Bihar’s Jeevika program – a World Bank supported initiative that focused on the poorest of the poor – extended Azamati the financial assistance to open a store. Today, Azamati brings in Rs. 5,000 ($62) a month, enabling her to notch up a tidy saving of nearly Rs. 50,000 ($625) in her bank account. </p>

        <h2>6 ways Indians can help their local community during the coronavirus crisis</h2>
        <h3>1. Fact-check before posting</h3>
        <details>
        <p>During a pandemic, when rumours and panic run amok, we need to be the watchdogs for our safety and others. On Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram or whatever broadcast service you prefer, beware of spreading alarmist news before fact-checking. Call the bluff on others who routinely share fake news too, this will help make them responsible citizens. </p></details>
        
        <br>
        <h3>2. Take the lead</h3>
        <details>
        <p>Start a Whatsapp group to share vetted information on services and provisions available in your locality. Take the initiative to make bulk orders for your block or apartment floor. This will ease panic and hoarding in areas that are scarce on commodities as well as help local businesses continue their practice in an orderly fashion. Hyperlocal support groups also come in handy in times of crisis. Mobilise community building efforts by compiling helpline numbers (hospitals, veterinarians, doctors, etc) that your community can seek in times of need.</p></details>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Help the elderly</h3>
        <details>
        <p>During a lockdown, the elderly population, a demographic more susceptible to the virus, can use your help. Identify the elderly and physically challenged people in your area and volunteer to assist them with daily needs—picking up their medicines, groceries and provisions or even setting up their online banking account to assist with everyday bills. Organisations like Caremongers India, started by Bengaluru professional Mahita Nagaraj last month, was launched to assist senior citizens and now boasts over 28,000 members.</p></details>
        <br>
        <h3>4. Support the vulnerable</h3>
        <details>
        <p>Charity begins at home. As millions of us in India take shelter at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, take a moment to think of those who do not have that privilege. Check with your staff—house help, security guard, building gardener—and insist on giving them weekly supplies. Extend it to others as well by donating to an NGO you support. Khushiyaan Foundation’s Roti Ghar initiative provides subsidised freshly-cooked meals (at just Rs 35) to underprivileged children in Mumbai. In Delhi, the Keshav Suri Foundation is distributing ration to the transgender community, who are left out of most welfare programmes in the country. In Chennai, two NGOs have come together to provide basic necessities to the healthcare workers, urban poor and migrant labourers. <br>

            There’s also Zomato’s Feed The Daily Wager project, a pan-India initiative to support families of daily-wage earners (with Rs 500 weekly meal kits) who are left unemployed with the country-wide lockdown. </p></details>
        <br>    
        <h3>5. Think about the strays</h3>
        <details>
        <p>With all of us living isolated lives, it is easy to forget those without a home. With restaurants only offering deliveries as per orders, city strays have little to fend for themselves. Leave out one meal and a bowl of water for animals that stray into your neighbourhood. On Ketto, donate towards campaigns to feed, medicate injured animals and support neighbourhood strays.</p></details>
        <br>
        <h3>6. Share your skills</h3>
        <details>
        <p>If your work allows you to spread the cheer, use it well to lift the spirits of others around. Stress and anxiety lower the immune system so it is important to try and stay positive and find ways to keep balance. If you are a yoga teacher, offer a class over Zoom to help your community stay active. Home chefs, share your cooking recipes and hacks during lockdown, when ingredients supplies are hard to come by. Musicians and artists, create work that others can enjoy. Green thumbed? Share your gardening knowledge for others to grow their kitchen garden. Graphic designers, take out an hour to design fundraising posters for organisations working on the ground. There’s a minefield of opportunity if your will is to volunteer. The Goa Humanitarian Helpline, a crowdsourced citizens initiative to help during the COVID-19 crisis, sees mental health practitioners from across India offer volunteering services remotely to people who need emotional support.</p></details>
